                        <p class="paragraph">
                            After the battle against Jack Brave, Orbis returns to its 
                            years of peace. Adam is now in charge of enforcing the new 
                            Laws of Coexistence between dimensions due to the pact with 
                            Lux. Novum has been dissolved due to the era of peace that 
                            now resides. The demons have decided to be peaceful entities. 
                            However, there are those who still oppose this. 
                        </p>

                            Avernis Blakthus, in charge of a city raised in the southern 
                            continent Malitae, Lunae Lumen, finds himself in the need to face a 
                            new unknown enemy who attacks the city.

                            This subject claims that all those related to demons must succumb, 
                            which is a violation of the Laws of Coexistence between dimensions. 
                            This battle will mark a new era in Orbis and in all dimensions.

                                maintain a relationship with demons. Avernis Blakthus decides to 
                                confront him.</dd>
                                <dt>Story:</dt>
                                <dd>2074/03/15. The subject turned out to be David, Adam's clone. 
                                The latter appears just when Avernis ends David's life. However, 
                                Adam decides to confront Avernis to avenge David's death. A battle 
                                between the human who reached a god level and the god who lost his 
                                humanity.</dd>
                                <dt>Epilogue:</dt>
                                <dd>0000/01/01. In the different turns of events and the confrontation 
                                against Cosmos. Adam makes a pact that mankind can no longer make use 
                                of spiritual energy and that the dimensions can no longer communicate 
                                with each other. Avernis returns to Orbis, a world that is reborn again 
                                without demons or angels. A world where humans will carry out his will.</dd>
