                            Adam and a huge squadron of angels are sent to Orbis with 
                            the mission to destroy the clone that the Orbis Government 
                            is creating before it is born. However, the clone is born

                            abilities to manipulate spiritual energy. The President, who 
                            learns of David's abilities from David's comments, sends a 
                            special squad to capture David for use in experiments. 
                            Witnessing his adoptive father turn his back on him,

                            imposed by the Orbis Government and there, he realizes that 
                            there are many things in the world that he has yet to discover, 
                            such as his own identity and origin.
