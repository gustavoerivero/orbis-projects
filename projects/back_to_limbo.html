                        <p class="paragraph">
                            This is the story of Shapiro Bosco, a member of the 
                            military group called Exilium who is in charge of 
                            fighting the anomalies called "demons" that appear 
                            in Orbis. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            In one of the missions assigned to the squadron to 
                            which Bosco belongs, he encounters a strange sword 
                            (Caelesti) that emanates a mystical energy. This sword 
                            is capable of using sacred energy to absorb cursed 
                            energy. However, in this exotic mission, an evil entity 
                            appears and with great speed eliminates Bosco's entire 
                            squadron, leaving him with a wound in his arm.

                            Weeks later, a being who calls himself "The Curse of Orbis" 
                            appears, who together with his "Horsemen of the Apocalypse" 
                            will seek to succumb to Orbis in the midst of chaos.
