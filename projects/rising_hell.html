                        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Adam finds himself in Orbis telling the Novum members 
                            who survived the battle that Lucifer has been sealed 
                            and that he died as a human and was "reborn" as a Seraphim. 
                            However, Adam senses that something bad is happening in 
                            Paradise and returns to see what is going on.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Upon returning to Paradise, he learns that Lucifer has been 
                            released and performed a pocession seal in the dimension. 
                            Adam goes directly to fight Lucifer, however, Lucifer has 
                            obtained his former Cherubic abilities and sends all the 
                            angels and Adam to Hell.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph"> 
                            Adam wakes up in Hell and realizes that he can neither use 
                            his holy abilities nor summon his weapon, Sanctus. So Adam 
                            will be in Hell on a quest to ascend to Orbis and return to 
                            Paradise to defeat Lucifer once and for all.
