                            Suddenly, an apparent soldier and his group take control 
                            of the Orbis Government. Cain Strongwilled, who is leading 
                            this group, comments that he is another clone created from 
                            the results obtained from David.

                            cities of Orbis to start the NeoGenesis project. David, who 
                            hears of this, goes to confront him, however, he loses his 
                            right arm in combat and retreats to Novum.

                            decides to stop the actions Cain is taking as the new
