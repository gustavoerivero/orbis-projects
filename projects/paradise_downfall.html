                            After 25 years of a great and arduous battle between a 
                            mysterious subject and a very powerful demon, two 
                            individuals were born; Eve, as a demon summoned with a 
                            woman's body and great abilities, and Adam, a human with 
                            an ability to adapt to situations faster than usual.
                        </p>

                            the Monarch of Hell, Lucifer, who is desperate to get his 
                            revenge after his exile from Paradise in the Battle of a 
                            Thousand Years and take control of Paradise.
                        </p>

                            Adam, meanwhile, had no idea what was going on around him 
                            until he witnessed events in a progressive way that prompted 
                            him to get involved in this battle of dimensional entities 
                            and stop Eve on her way to bring Lucifer to Orbis.
