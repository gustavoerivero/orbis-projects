                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Peace returns to Orbis after years of wars and battles. 
                            However, this peace is interrupted after the awakening 
                            of Chaos, a god of the underworld who has been in a 
                            deep sleep for thousands of years.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Chaos was divided into three entities in the past and 
                            now he will seek to reunite the pieces of the relic 
                            that will allow the fusion of these entities and thus 
                            become whole again.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Ventus Inferos, Malum Petram and Juravit Malum, the 
                            divided entities of Chaos, where each one will go to 
                            a specific dimension to recover the pieces of the 
                            relic that sealed and divided it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph"> 
                            On the other hand, Paradise, Hell and Orbis feel the 
                            awakening of the parts of Chaos, so they prepare for 
                            one of the most difficult confrontations of their 
                            lives.
